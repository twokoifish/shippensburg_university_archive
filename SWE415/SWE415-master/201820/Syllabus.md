## Class Activities
### Tutorials 
The primary tool we need to learn is Ruby on Rails, but you will do this primarily in the first two weeks of class by completing the tutorial at [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)

In addition, you must complete two online git tutorials: [basic git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) and [more thorough git](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)

### Projects
You will work on real projects as part of a team for the purpose of practicing agile development techniques and philosophies.  Your grade will depend on the extent to which you follow those practices.

### Exam
There will be one “final” exam in the third week of the semester.  Its purpose is to make sure that you understand Ruby on Rails and the specific implementation of XP that we will use for the rest of the semester.  

### CATME

We will use CATME to give everyone feedback on how they are doing in this class.  You are required to complete the CATME activity every iteration

### Journal
You are required to keep a journal of your thoughts about this class.  This serves two purposes.  First, and foremost, software engineers think about how things are going and how things can go better.  This journal is the beginning of helping you learn to think like that.  Second, much of what happens in this class is part of a project and your journals give me feedback to help me make sure this experience is a valuable one.  So, EVERY TIME you do something for this class (read, work on the project, come to class, etc.) you must make an entry in that journal.  

I will watch these journals regularly to make sure that I am getting the feedback you give, but the goal is for you to think about what is going on around you and how you can best be a productive team member.  The journal’s purpose is NOT to report on what you accomplished (we have other means of doing that) and I will NOT use it to gauge how much work you are doing in the class.  I expect to see thoughtful analysis of your experiences.

This journal MUST be a google doc named (your last name)XPJournal that you share so that I can comment (NOT edit!). Each entry must be dated, state what you did for the class and then contain your thoughts about that activity.  

## Time Reporting
All engineering companies will ask you to make status reports on how you have spent your time.  We will have a shared google sheet where you will report the hours you work, what you work on and who you worked on it with.  Accuracy is important and errors in either direction (reporting hours you didn't work or not reporting hours you did work) are academic dishonesty.

## Grades
Your grade has two major components: a Quality grade and a Professionalism grade. The two portions of your grade are multiplied together to determine your final grade in the course.

Your Quality grade is determined by the extent to which you meet the requirements of a specific assignment. Each deliverable or quiz will be worth a certain percentage of your Quality grade. 

Your quality grade will be calculated as follows:

Tutorials & journal: 20% <br>
Iteration #1: 10%<br>
Iteration #2: 10%<br>
Iteration #3: 15%<br>
Iteration #4: 20%<br>
Exam:  25%

The grades for each iteration will be based on how you work in class, how you work with your team outside of class, the extent to which your team meets its responsibilities and feedback from your teammates on how you interact with them.

Your Professionalism grade is the grade you receive for your ability to perform in this course as you will be expected to perform in the workplace.   The goal of this part of the grade is to help you understand how an employer forms an opinion of you.  When you are hired, they have high hopes for you and respect your professionalism.  Each time you disappoint your manager, his/her opinion of your professionalism goes down.  For us, you disappoint us by not:

* Arriving to class on time & prepared to participate
* Attending all classes
* Participating fully and respectfully in class discussions, offering constructive critiques on your classmates’ work
* Responding graciously to constructive criticism
* Submitting your work compete and on time
* Attending all required meetings with your team prepared
* Communicating fully about your progress with your team and technical lead (instructor)
* Following our agile development process
* Communicating promptly with the course instructor and your team about any illnesses, emergencies, or family obligations you may have
* Providing documentation for any of the above listed reasons for missing class or falling behind on your schedule.

Like your employer’s opinion, our Professionalism grade starts at 100% and can only go down. There are no opportunities for you to gain back points once they are lost in this portion of your grade. If your Professionalism grade drops below 60%, it will be impossible for you to pass this course. Do not let this happen.  Here are some examples of how unprofessional behavior will affect your professionalism grade:

* Missing or not thoughtful journal entry:  -2 pts
* Unexcused Lateness: -2 pts (late to class, late to a meeting)
* Excused Late/absence: -1 pt (after the first 3 excused absences)
* Incomplete submission: -1 to -4 pts (depending on how much is missing)
* Unexcused missed deadline: -1 pt for each day late up to a maximum of five.  After that point, you cannot submit that deliverable
* Unexcused missed class or team meeting: -5 pts
* Inappropriate behavior in meetings with a customer:  -1 to -10 pts
* Misc. transgressions: -1 to -10 pts (being a jackass during another student's critique, for example) at instructor’s discretion

Your manager’s opinion of your work degrades as his respect for your professionalism degrades.  Therefore, your grade in this class is the **product** of the grade for the quality of your deliverables and your professionalism grade.

## Policies
### Academic Dishonesty
The university has a strong academic dishonesty policy which I will strictly enforce. Guard your work to be sure that no one else "borrows" it. You should be certain to read the definitions of academic dishonesty and the university's policy in the Swataney.
### Social Equity Accommodations
If you are registered with the Office of Social Equity as needing special accommodations like extra time on exams, please come see me so that we can iron out the details.
