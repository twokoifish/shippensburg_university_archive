Respond to the prompts, enter ? for unknown:
Rate of heat transfer (watts) >> Coefficient of thermal conductivity (W/m-K) >> Cross-sectional area of conductor: (W^2) >> Temperature on one side (K) >> Temperature on other side (K) >> Thickness of conductor (m) >> Thickness 0.0500 m.
H = 830.5 W               T2 = 302 K
k = 0.7500 W/m-K               T1 = 117 K
A = 0.300 m^2               X = 0.0500 K
