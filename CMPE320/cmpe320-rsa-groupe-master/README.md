# CMPE320-RSA-GroupE

## Ideas
- Try using a prime number generator so we don't wait time checking non-prime odds.
    - Maybe the sieve of Eratosthenes?
    
- Use threads to break up the set of primes?
    - It would allow us to crack multiple keys at one.
    
- If the number in the loop is not prime.

- Try making the find key take in input. It would allow us to figure out what key size to crack.
